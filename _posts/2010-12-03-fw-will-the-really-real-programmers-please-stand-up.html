<p>I was reading the CodeProject newsletter the other day, and this article caught my attention: <a href="http://stevenbenner.com/2010/08/will-the-really-real-programmers-please-stand-up/">Will the really real programmers please stand up!</a> The article speaks about the "real" programmers and how do you recognize one. (I do hope to come up one day with my own definition of a good programmer versus bad programmer)<br />
It follows a series of other good articles about developers, good developers and hiring developers. Just one more article that caught my attention: <a href="http://blog.mathgladiator.com/2010/11/3-programming-languages-you-need-to.html">Programming languages you need to know</a></p>
