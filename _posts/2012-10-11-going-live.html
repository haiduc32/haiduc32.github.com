<p>Not many developers know how is it to go live with a project. And I'm not talking about one man shows or small websites. A one year, 10 people kind of project.<br />
Now think bigger. A 2 year, 10 to 30 people (not including the people involved on the client's side), financial project. Lots and lots of business logic, processes, integration with existing processes. Teams dedicated to keeping different environments</p>
