<p>Everybody knows the ternary operator <strong>?</strong>. It can be found in most languages like C/C++, Java, C#, PHP and JS. But how many C# developers know about the binary operator <strong>??</strong> ? Apparently not so many.<br />
<strong>??</strong> is a great little thing introduced along with null-able types in .NET 2.0. It's meant to eliminate some ifs in your code when working with types that can be null. Unfortunately it is not so widely used.<br />
Let's check an example:<br />
[csharp]<br />
int GetTeamPoints(User user)<br />
{<br />
    int? teamPoints;</p>
<p>    using (DBDataContext db = new DBDataContext())<br />
    {<br />
        teamPoints = db.Users.Where(x =&gt; x.Team == user.Team)<br />
            .Sum(x =&gt; x.Points);<br />
    }</p>
<p>    if (teamPoints == null)<br />
        teamPoints = 0;</p>
<p>    return teamPoints.Value;<br />
}<br />
[/csharp]<br />
The code works ok, but how about the next example:<br />
[csharp]<br />
int GetTeamPoints(User user)<br />
{<br />
    int? teamPoints;</p>
<p>    using (DBDataContext db = new DBDataContext())<br />
    {<br />
        teamPoints = db.Users.Where(x =&gt; x.Team == user.Team)<br />
            .Sum(x =&gt; x.Points);<br />
    }</p>
<p>    return teamPoints ?? 0;<br />
}<br />
[/csharp]<br />
Ah, now it looks so much cleaner. And it's faster by a few processor cycles.<br />
Although <strong>??</strong> has been introduced especially for working with nullable types, it can work with reference types as well, returning a value when the object is null.</p>
