<p>Now this post is about an older project of mine (and by old I mean a couple of months). I had trouble with it's hosting and was delaying it's publicÂ announcement.</p>
<p>The idea behind Prices On .Net is simple, you are interested in buying something online that is expensive and want to wait till the price drops, you enter on <a title="http://priceson.net" href="http://priceson.net">http://priceson.net</a>, register the link and when the price does drop you get a notification email. (If anybody knows a free SMS service please drop a comment). Any link to any web site can be added. On the admin area there is a very spartan interface for adding configurations for new web sites when links to unsupported web sites are added (sorry, you are not allowed there :).</p>
<p>I just needed a simple way to keep an eye on some SSDs I was interested on, also some android phones, a couple of amazon books. So I decided to build a simple tool to do the monitoring, but then I figured more people might be interested in a such a service, and so the web site was born.</p>
<p>As simple is the idea as simple is the web site. Nothing fancy, minimalist style. Please, leave a comment if you have any suggestions.</p>
<p>P. S. And while you're at it, don't forget to give it a Recommend on facebook (on the bottom of the page) ;)</p>
