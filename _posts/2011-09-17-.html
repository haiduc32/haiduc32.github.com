<p>Recently I had a task with which I got very frustrated, and almost desperate. Firstly, I had to port some functionality from VB to C# and VB is a totally unfamiliar language to me. Second most of it was actually in Stored Procedures in Oracle that I had to invoke. And Oracle is like a hostile territory with a "Minefield" sign. So what I had to do was figure out what stored procedures where invoked from VB, then write a stored procedure that was invoking them with the right parameters (tough job when there are 50), and hope that I wired it by the rightÂ colors.</p>
<p>Of course nothing went by the plan. The initial list o SPs that I received wasn't the full one, as I discovered from looking into the VB code. Matching the parameters was pain in the.. Once my SP was ready it didn't do the job right. Me and my colleague spent 2 days just debugging and tuning the parameters. At times I was desperate. Just when we thought it should be working it would refuse very rudely.</p>
<p>3 ways developers halt in their tasks and how to kick start them:</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes developers get desperate. For example when something isn't behaving as it is expected to. pair programming or another developer investigating into the same problem is very helpful more as a moral supporter.</li>
<li>sometimes developers get blocked. when they are solving a problem, there is usually a base that they have build, an idea that they follow, and if it is a wrong one, they might get tangled in it and not see a way out. Having somebody just to talk about that usually helps.</li>
<li>- they stumble on funcionality that they don't understand or have knowledge of. help them</li>
</ul>
<p>A general idea for all developers when they get to a halt: stop. take a brake away from the computer, first talk to somebody about anything except your problem. Then talk about your problem with another developer. Get back to solving the problem but try to look at it from a different angle. Look at the problem in a wider context.</p>
