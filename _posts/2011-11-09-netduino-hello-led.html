<p>Are you a .Net developer but you also dream of doing some electronic projects, like.. blinking leds? There is a app.. err.. board, for that. Netduino is the name.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="netduino" src="assets/photo_overhead.gif" alt="" width="359" height="270" /></p>
<p>I'll go on with a short description of what is it. Netduino is a small board, with a form factors same as Arduino, a very popular prototyping board. Netduino is easy to connect to the computer with a usb cable, all written software is deployed with a simple run button click. The software is written in C#, with the the .Net 4.1 Micro Framework. The new version of the Micro Framework, 4.2, has support for VB.</p>
<p>As for electronic features, it has 14 general purpose input-output ports. Connect LEDs to them and make them blink, or control the garage gates if you like.. 6 analog ports are handy if you want to hook up a temperature sensor, or any other thing that has an analog output. It can handle UART, SPI or I2C interfaces so you can add any other piece of electronics that needs a communication interface. Controling servo motors is easy as well with PWM.</p>
<p>Thirst thing I did when I got it was blinking 2 leds, the code is as follows (one is an onboard led another one I hooked to GPIO13):</p>

using Microsoft.SPOT.Hardware;<br />
using SecretLabs.NETMF.Hardware;<br />
using SecretLabs.NETMF.Hardware.Netduino;</p>
<p>namespace NetduinoApplication1<br />
{<br />
  public class Program<br />
  {<br />
    public static void Main()<br />
    {<br />
      OutputPort ledBlue = new OutputPort(Pins.ONBOARD_LED,<br />
        false);<br />
      OutputPort ledRed = new OutputPort(Pins.GPIO_PIN_D13,<br />
        false);<br />
      const int colorBlinkCount = 4;<br />
      const int colorTime = 50; //ms</p>
<p>      while (true)<br />
      {<br />
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; colorBlinkCount; i++)<br />
        {<br />
          ledBlue.Write(true);<br />
          Thread.Sleep(colorTime);<br />
          ledBlue.Write(false);<br />
          Thread.Sleep(colorTime);<br />
        }</p>
<p>        for (int i = 0; i &lt; colorBlinkCount; i++)<br />
        {<br />
          ledRed.Write(true);<br />
          Thread.Sleep(colorTime);<br />
          ledRed.Write(false);<br />
          Thread.Sleep(colorTime);<br />
        }<br />
      }<br />
    }</p>
<p>  }<br />
}<br />
[/csharp]</p>
<p>And the web site <a href="http://www.netduino.com/">netduino.com</a>. A place where you can buy it with reasonable shipment price <a title="sparkfun.com" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/search/results?term=netduino&amp;what=products">sparkfun.com</a>. As you can see on the latest link, it comes in 3 flavors, the mini, the standard and pro with network capability.</p>
<p>.Net FTW!</p>
