<p>Wars. Wars have always been around since humans learned to walk on two feet and handle a bat. Wars will still be around for a long time. Wars happen for various reasons, but I'll not enumerate any of them as I don't want to go into politics (because politics is a dirty business).</p>
<p>Technology. Technology for a modern human being might mean iPhones, laptops, space shuttles, but just as the very first bat that the humans learned to handle it's a product of our inventiveness. The rate of our technological advancement grew exponentially after the industrial revolution. It is still growing.</p>
<p>Culture. Meaning humanity in this context. Evolved at a very slow pace through the history. Had lots of downfalls, most recent big event happening in the late 30's and early 40's.</p>
<p>In the last century we excelled at 2 out of 3. Want to take a lucky guess at which? We managed to have 2 world wars (nothing like anything before in our history). We learned to fly, build nukes and send people into space. All in one century.</p>
<p>We didn't manage to advance in culture. We are at the same level we were about 100 years ago. 100 years means roughly 4 generations of people that should've aspired to higher goals for humanity. Instead what we have today is television that promotes violence, hatred and rebellion against culture. That's not a bright future for culture. Another downfall, may be even worse than the previous one.</p>
<p>But what does culture has in common with wars and technology you ask? The technology we have today is too advanced for our level of culture. We have the means to bring our planet into a nuclear winter, and a very low culture to avoid this (an american president and a russian state secretary almost pushed the red buttons back in 62).</p>
<p>The technology that is available to any person is high enough for building guided missiles to bring down plains, building drones to deliver explosive charges,</p>
