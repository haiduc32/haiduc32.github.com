<p>This is the first article from a series (at least I hope so) of articles dedicated to bad coding.<br />
Currently, at my day-job we are refactoring a WPF project to MVVM. Important to inform you that project was not developed in our company! There are a lot of "weird stuff" going on in the code. I'll try to cover a few things that look funny or really weird.</p>
<p>Here is the C# 3.5 snippet. Consider value as IEnumerable.<br />
[csharp]<br />
// Set the contact person's value(s) if allowed.<br />
if (value.ToList() == ContactRole.AvailableContacts) return;<br />
[/csharp]<br />
The intention is clear, the guy wanted to compare 2 lists but.. failed.</p>
<p>More to come.</p>
