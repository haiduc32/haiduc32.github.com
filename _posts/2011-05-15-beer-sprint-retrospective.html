<p>If you are familiar with Agil development using Scrum, you know there is a Sprint retrospective at the end of each Sprint. A time-boxed meeting where everybody is stating his point of view on what went good, what went bad and how to improve.</p>
<p>Because of a number of circumstances the sprint review was always held at the end of the day, in the remaining time till EOD. That was a problem since sometimes there wasn't any time, and everybody was getting stressed and anxious to get on with their own business. Consider that factor and as well the incapability of the human brain to focus on a single thing (in this context sprint retrospective), and instead of making a quick and very focused sprint retrospective where everybody could lay out their opinions it was more of a quarrel and nobody could finish without getting interrupted. So there was no way of keeping it short, the more stressed the people were the longer was the meeting. (I wander if the game theory can be applied for such problems).</p>
<p>It was a sunny day, about lunch time, when a colleague of mine had a genius idea, why not have the retrospective meeting out of office? The suggestion was gladly accepted by everyone. The next retrospective meeting was held out of office, in a nice place with good pizza and beer. Beer was the most important ingredient as it helped to open up everybody, and help to discuss without stress all the encountered problems, brainstorm for solutions, and just have a good time. I must say it was the most productive sprint retrospective ever. First of all nobody was anxious to leave because it's six o'clock. Second it was more like an open discussion with a lead speaker.</p>
<p>And one important thing, the scrum master buys the first round of drinks ;)</p>
