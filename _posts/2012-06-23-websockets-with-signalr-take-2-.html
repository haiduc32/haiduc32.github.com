<p>Last week I posted an introductory post on SignalR. The focuse was getting started with it. I used the concept of Hubs from SignalR. Hubs get you started very fast but also have a downside - the messages are encapsulated in an envelope, like:<br />
[js]<br />
{&quot;hub&quot;:&quot;chatHub&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;Message&quot;,&quot;args&quot;:[&quot;my message&quot;],&quot;state&quot;:{},&quot;id&quot;:1}<br />
[/js]</p>
