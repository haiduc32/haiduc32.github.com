Who am I?
Let's see..

Dreamer, developer, Cloud fanatic, tinkerer, aspiring harmonica player, audiophiliac, ex biker, chess player, sci-fy books and movies fan, ex gamer (and trying hard to keep it that way), and occasional blogger.

Professionally I work mainly with .NET technologies but on my free time I like to tinker with all kind of [crazy] stuff. Most recently I've been playing with optimizing Matlab scripts with GPU, and also writing highly optimized code on CUDA with C++. It's been painful and fun.
